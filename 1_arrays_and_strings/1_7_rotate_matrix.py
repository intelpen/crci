# 1.7 Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
# bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

# solution : Not in place replace lines with columns
# in place keep only 1 element and do a rotation of all elements on each outer border 4 times -> complicated but doable
